I was trying to think of a game. Then I had to go. While I was in the bathroom I thought what if I was able to pee for exactly 10 seconds!

Title: Hold it

pick drinks: water / soda / beer / coffee

pick how much time to hold it.

If you don't die, see how long you last.

maybe get art from: OpenGameArt.org
